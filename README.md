# Traffic-flow-violations-detection-using-dashcams 

Description: The project aims to develop an intelligent system for monitoring and detecting traffic flow violations using dashcam footage. With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, ensuring compliance with traffic laws is critical for maintain society and reducing accidents. Traditional methods of traffic monitoring involve manual surveillance and stationary cameras, which have limitations in terms of coverage and real time response. This project leverages the capabilities of dashcams combined with advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to create a robust solution for traffic violation detection
Objectives:
 Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Utilize dashcams installed in vehicles to continuously capture video footage of the surrounding traffic environment.
 Violation Detection: Develop algorithms to detect common traffic violations such as speeding, illegal lane changes, running red lights, and improper parking. 
Data Analysis and Reporting: Implement a system for analyzing the captured footage to identify violations and generate comprehensive reports with timestamps, location data, and evidence.
Integration with Law Enforcement: Create a platform for securely sharing violation reports and evidence with traffic authorities to facilitate timely enforcement and penalty issuance
